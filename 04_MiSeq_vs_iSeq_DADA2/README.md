# Analyzing MiSeq and iSeq fastq files using DADA2
Both Illumina MiSeq and iSeq can generate sequences that are suitable for 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analysis.
However, fastq files that are generated by iSeq contain only three types of Q-scores, 11 (,), 25 (;) and 37 (F). In this folder, I briefly examined how these differences influence DADA2 sequence analysis.

# General procedure
1. Start from MiSeq fastq files (0-39) (Example fastq files are in 02_DemultiplexedOut_MiSeqStyle). Note that, although I analyzed 252 fastq files (= 126 samples), only six fastq files are in 02_DemultiplexedOut_MiSeqStyle becuase the results are not published yet (a preprint is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.032524">here</a>).
2. Manually convert MiSeq Q-scores to iSeq Q-scores using a shell script (Example fastq files are in 02_DemultiplexedOut_iSeqStyle).
