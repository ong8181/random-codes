# Analyzing MiSeq and iSeq fastq files using DADA2
Both Illumina MiSeq and iSeq can generate sequences that are suitable for 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analysis.
However, fastq files that are generated by iSeq contain only three types of Q-scores, 11 (,), 25 (;) and 37 (F). In this folder, I briefly examined how these differences influence DADA2 sequence analysis.
