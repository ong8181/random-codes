# Manual implementation of the regularized S-map
The regularized S-map implemented according to Cenci et al. (2019) <i>Methods in Ecology and Evolution</i> (https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13150)

Currently, the regularization relies on "glmnet" package of R.

## Test results
Regularized S-map functions are in "functions" folder, and they are tested in 01_RegularizedSmap.R. Accordign to a test using a subset of the data in Ushio et al. (2018) (see "data" folder), ridge (or lasso) S-map shows a better performance than the standard S-map, which is consistent with Cenci et al. (2019) (run 01_RegularizedSmap.R or see "figs" folder). Current implementations of the regularized and standard S-map are much slower than the standard S-map in rEDM package of R.

## Usage
Regularized S-map can be performed using ```extended_lnlp()``` function. The default setting of ```extended_lnlp()``` function is as follows (it has similar parameters to ```block_lnlp()``` function in rEDM package):

``` r
extended_lnlp(block_time,
              lib = c(1, NROW(block_time)),
              pred = lib,
              tp = 1,
              target_column = 1,
              lib_column = 1:NCOL(block_time),
              num_neighbors = NCOL(block_time) + 1,
              theta = 0,
              method = "s-map",
              regularized = FALSE,
              lambda = NULL,
              alpha = 0,
              glmnet_parallel = FALSE,
              random_seed = NULL,
              no_parallel = glmnet_parallel,
              save_smap_coefficients = FALSE)
```

Here are descriptions of some important parameters:
- `block_time`: Dataframe or matrix.
- `method`: Specify method to make predictions (currently only "s-map" is valid).
- `theta`: Nonlinearity parameter for S-map.
- `regularized`: Specify whether regularized or standard S-map is used.
- `lambda`: Tuning parameter for regularization. If `lambda = 0`, there will be no regularization. If `lambda = NULL`, optimal `lambda` is determined for each prediction using k-fold cross validation (currently this option is not recommended).
- `alpha`: Tuning parameter for elastic net. If `alpha = 0`, ridge regression will be performed. If `alpha = 1`, lasso regression will be performed.
- `random_seed`: Set this seed to reproduce results of the parallel computation mode.
- `no_parallel`: If `FALSE`, then the computation will be parallel.
