# Echo State Network (ESN)
Echo Stata Network (ESN) approach is an approach to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) training. Here ESN is implemented with Python according to a tutrial described by Herbert Jaeger (http://minds.jacobs-university.de/uploads/papers/ESNTutorialRev.pdf).

For MNIST image classification, the algorithm is further revised according to Schaetti et al. (2016) https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02131170.
